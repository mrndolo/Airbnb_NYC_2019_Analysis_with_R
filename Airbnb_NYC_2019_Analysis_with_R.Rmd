## Introduction
In this analysis, I will explore the 2019 Airbnb listings data for New York City. My main goals are:

* To clean and structure the dataset for accurate analysis.

* To generate insights about Airbnb listings through visualizations.

* To build predictive models to understand factors influencing price and customer behaviors

I aim to identify trends in room types, pricing, and availability across neighborhoods. Additionally, I will use machine learning models to predict prices and group listings into clusters.
